# Fish-Weight-Estimation
The aim of this study is to estimate weight of the fish indivuduals from their measurements through using linear regression model.  This study can be improved to use in fish farms. Individual fish swimming in front of the camera can be measured from the video image and the weight of the fish can be estimated through the linear regression model.
